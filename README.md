# Bookster

## Overview
**Bookster** is a personalized book recommendation system that leverages hybrid recommendation techniques, combining collaborative and content-based filtering to deliver tailored book suggestions. This project was developed as an academic exercise for a school course in Data Mining and Machine Learning. While inactive now, the project showcases the application of advanced algorithms in recommendation systems, alongside clean and responsive front-end design.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides book suggestions based on user preferences, ratings, and similar user behavior.
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**:
  - Collaborative Filtering: Suggests books based on ratings from similar users.
  - Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books based on genre, author, and metadata.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built using **Angular** for a Netflix-style user experience.
- **Backend and Database**: 
  - **Flask** backend with REST APIs to serve recommendations.
  - **PostgreSQL** for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented using Python libraries like **Scikit-Learn**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **SciPy**.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
- **Design**: Figma for UI/UX prototyping

## How It Works
1. **User Data**: Users provide book ratings or interact with the system.
2. **Hybrid Model**:
   - Collaborative filtering uses similarity metrics to find users with similar tastes.
   - Content-based filtering analyzes book metadata to match preferences.
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Combines results from both methods to present personalized recommendations.
4. **Frontend Display**: A dynamic, visually appealing interface showcases recommended books and allows users to explore further.
